## 🧠 AI Research Travel Agent
### An IBM Cloud-based intelligent research assistant designed to streamline academic literature reviews using NLP and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This project leverages IBM's Granite foundation model to help users navigate, summarize, and extract insights from large volumes of academic and technical content.

## 📌 Problem Statement
### Researchers, students, and professionals often struggle to stay updated with the rapidly growing volume of academic publications, datasets, and trends. Manually reviewing and filtering this data is inefficient and time-consuming.

## ✅ Proposed Solution:
## An AI-powered Research Agent that uses NLP and RAG to:
### Conduct efficient literature reviews
### Generate concise summaries
### Identify research gaps
### Recommend relevant papers, datasets, or collaborators

## 🧰 Technologies Used
### IBM Cloud Lite Services
### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
### IBM Granite Foundation Model  

## ✨ Wow Factors
### 🔍 Semantic search across journals and datasets
### 📝 Auto-summarization of selected papers
### 🔗 Citation/reference analysis to trace research influence
### 📚 Paper recommendations based on user topic
### 📈 Trend analysis over time
### 🤝 Collaboration mapping (co-authors, institutions)

## 👥 End Users
### Academic Researchers
### Research Institutions and Universities
### Industry R&D Teams
### Educators
